This little tool is under construction. It was made out of boredom during my travel to the city where I work.

This is supposed to help you organize your files using a yaml file, something like this:

rules:
  my_pictures:
    pattern: (\w*)\.jpg
    folder: ~/Pictures
  my_trip:
    pattern: Trip.*jpg
    folder: ~/Pictures/My Trip
  my_series:
    pattern: ^([\w\s]*)\.s(\d{2}).*\.avi$
    folder: ~/Series/$1/Season $2/
